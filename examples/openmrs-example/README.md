# openmrs-example

This example shows how to package up OpenMRS esm packages for local / offline use.

Take a look at the [`frontend`](frontend) directory to see the directory generated by packmap. That directory should go into the OpenMRS Application Data directory as the frontend directory.

## Local development
To try out this code locally, run the following inside of the `openmrs-example` directory:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

This will regenerate the `frontend` directory with the contents of your package.json file and node_modules.
